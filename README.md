# ChessAI

This is a repository where I will be putting some code related to a chess engine I am building.


Currently the version of TensorFlow used in this code is 1.3.0, although some of the code may still be built for 1.2.1 (which will be converted soon).


# Current Code and Future Plans

-Use inception based convolutional neural networks as a method of scoring a given chess board
-Design and build a neural network based approach to move ordering
-Implement BNS utilizing  neural networks to estimate/adjust internal values
-Implement zero-window Negamax algorithm (likely heavily modified),  in a parallelized manner
-Implement opening and closing game position tables

Much, much more information/code to come!
