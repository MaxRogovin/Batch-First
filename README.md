# ChessAI

This is a repository where I will be putting some code related to a chess playing AI I am building.

As of now I am attempting to use an inception based convolutional neural network to predict the probability that either player will win.


Currently the version of TensorFlow used in this code is 1.2.1.

Much, much more information to come!
