# ChessAI

This is a repository where I will be putting some code related to a chess playing AI I am building.

As of now I am attempting to use an inception based convolutional neural network to predict the probability that either player will win.


Currently the version of TensorFlow used in this code is 1.2.1.


# Current Plans

-Use inception based convolutional neural networks as a method of scoring a given chess board
-Design and build a neural network based approach to move ordering  (Currently thinking of using RNNs)
-Write an efficient (and likely heavily modified) version of an alpha-beta pruning algorithm (likely in C)
-Implement opening and closing game position tables
-Determine if I should create complete AI myself, or contribute to an open source engine

Much, much more information/code to come!
